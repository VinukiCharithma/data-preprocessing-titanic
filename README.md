ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing Techniques (Titanic Dataset)

This project demonstrates three essential data preprocessing techniques applied on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Each technique includes description, example, and Python demo.

ðŸš€ Techniques Covered

Binning (Discretization) â€“ Grouping continuous values (e.g., Age) into categories (Child, Teen, Adult, Senior).

Transformation â€“ Applying mathematical functions (e.g., log transform on Fare to reduce skewness).

Normalization â€“ Scaling values (e.g., Age, Fare) into a [0, 1] range using Min-Max scaling.
